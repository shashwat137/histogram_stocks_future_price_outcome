# histogram_stocks_future_price_outcome
Created and demonstrated a function for a histogram of future returns based on some financial data.

### Description
Create a function for a dataset of ~5 years of data on large cap US stocks. The function provides a histogram of the future price return outcomes of stocks with specific characteristics. The funnction must have 3 inputs namely metric, value and timeframe. Metric would allow the user to choose a ratio (for example price/epsNTM, entrVal/ebitdaNTM, entrVal/salesNTM, roe and pB). Value would allow the user to select the minimum value to be observed to classify the stock in the universe based on user requirement. Timeframe is the length of time over which to calculate pricce change into the future. 
This is one histogram overall, not for every stock. The output of the function is a chart and a data frame of binned returns and their frequencies. 
For the function, the user may also optionally input the data or select the number of bins.
